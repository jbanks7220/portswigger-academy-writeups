# 🛡️ Web Security Academy Labs: SQL Injection Exploitation
## 🧠 Objective
These labs demonstrate how SQL injection vulnerabilities can be exploited to:

Retrieve hidden data from a database.

### 🧩 SQL Injection in WHERE Clause – Retrieving Hidden Data
**🔍 Step 1: Identifying the Injection Point**

I began by analyzing the URL structure and noticed the category parameter was passed directly to the backend. This hinted at a potential injection point.

**🧪 Step 2: Testing for SQL Injection**

Injecting a single quote (') caused a server error, confirming that the input was being processed by a SQL query.

**🧬 Step 3: Crafting the Payload**

I used the classic ' OR 1=1-- payload to bypass the WHERE clause condition. This forced the query to return all rows, including hidden data.

**✅ Step 4: Successful Exploitation**

The lab confirmed that the injection worked and hidden product categories were revealed. Mission accomplished.

### 🧠 Key Takeaways
SQL injection can expose hidden or unauthorized data.

Always validate and sanitize user input.

Even simple payloads can have serious consequences.
