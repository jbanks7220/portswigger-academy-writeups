# 🛡️ Web Security Academy Lab: Basic SSRF Against the Local Server
## 🧠 Objective
Exploit a Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability to interact with internal services and perform unauthorized actions—specifically, delete the user carlos.

## 🧩 Step-by-Step Exploitation Walkthrough
### 🔍 Step 1: Reconnaissance

I began by analyzing the product page, which included a dropdown for store locations and a “Check stock” button. This triggered a POST request to /product/stock, suggesting a backend API call.

### 🧪 Step 2: Intercepting the Request

I intercepted the request and found the stockApi parameter pointing to an external service:

```
stockApi=http://stock.weliketoshop.net:8080/product/stock/&productId=2&storeId=1
```

This indicated that the server was making a request to the URL provided—classic SSRF behavior.

### 🧬 Step 3: Redirecting to Internal Services

I changed the stockApi parameter to point to http://localhost/admin, attempting to access internal services not exposed to the public.

### 🎯 Step 4: Targeting the Admin Endpoint

This payload attempted to delete the user carlos by exploiting the SSRF to reach the internal admin panel.

```
stockApi=http://localhost/admin/delete?username=carlos
```

### ✅ Step 5: Confirming the Exploit

The server should respond with a success message, confirming that the SSRF was successful and the internal admin endpoint was triggered. In my case, this lab was already completed so instead it returned a "302 Found" status code, meaning that carlos had been temporarily removed.

### 🏁 Step 6: Lab Completion

The lab validated the exploit and marked it as complete.

### 🧠 Key Takeaways
SSRF vulnerabilities allow attackers to make requests from the server to internal or protected resources.

Always validate and restrict user-supplied URLs in backend requests.

Internal services should be protected with authentication and network segmentation.
